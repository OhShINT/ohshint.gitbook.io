Figured it was time to actually document some of my work. This blog is mostly going to be articles, write-ups and other ramblings about a few different intelligence and counter-intelligence subjects.

Including anything related to open-source intelligence, operational security, anonymity, surveillance and counter-surveillance techniques, trade-craft, and probably a little bit of cyber-security related content. 

A little backstory about the author (me). I am a licensed private investigator who has specialized in the art of intelligence collection, surveillance, and counter-surveillance operations. 

Some of my other hobbies include cyber-security, internet culture, firearms technology, forensic document examination, and general spy-craft related things. There will be articles about all of these different subjects here soon, as I have planned to post a new article every week if time permits and can actually get away from my busy schedule.

Here are some topics that I will be covering *eventually*.

- *Everything and related to OSINT investigations, intelligence discovery and intelligence collection. Including lists of resources and tools, write-ups of my OSINT research, guides and different techniques on how to conduct OSINT investigations on a vast amount of different platforms and subjects.*
- *OPSEC and privacy research, guides, and other anonymity things.*
- *Trade-craft techniques and other things related to general spy-craft.*
- *Surveillance tactics and techniques, covert photography and evidence collection.*
- *Both physical and digital counter-surveillance tactics. Things related to TSCM, such as guides and research.*
- *Cyber-security related articles, techniques, CTF writeups and other random InfoSec related things.*
- *Probably more stuff.*

Anyways, thank you for reading my blog and I genuinely hope you enjoy the content! If not well, I can't really help you with that. 

Welcome aboard my ship friends, hope you decide to stay for a while and learn about some cool stuff together.
