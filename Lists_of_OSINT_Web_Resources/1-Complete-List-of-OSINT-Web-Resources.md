Oh look, its *yet another* list of OSINT resources..

Since I do mainly do OSINT work for a living, you can imagine that I have accumulated a huge amount of resources and tools to assist me in locating certain information about certain things over the years. Figured I should share them in a mostly organized fashion, because sharing is caring right?

These lists are currently still a work in progress! It was going to take ages to write so I've decided to just publish what I already have and continue to push updates on the live versions. So stay tuned for more.
